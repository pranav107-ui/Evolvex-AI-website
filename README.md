# EvolveX Website - Starter

Purpose: Implement Figma designs with minimal animations; animation hooks are provided for future enhancement.

To preview: open index.html in a browser. Optional: use live-server for auto reload.

Animation hooks: elements with `data-animate` get `.in-view` when visible.
