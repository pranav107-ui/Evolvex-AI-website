# EvolveX Website - Starter

Purpose: Implement Figma designs with minimal animations; animation hooks are provided for future enhancement.

To preview: open index.html in a browser. Optional: use live-server for auto reload.

Animation hooks: elements with `data-animate` get `.in-view` when visible.

## Design System Rules
- **Units**: Strictly **PX only**. All `rem` units have been converted to `px` (1rem = 16px).
- **Future Development**: Do not use `rem`, `em`, or other relative units for typography, spacing, or fixed dimensions.
